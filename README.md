Fuel Density Android and iOS App
===========================
Fuel Density is another name for fuel weight. It's something that I have to tell to business that calls me each morning and is the motivation for this app.
I figured out that the density value calculated by the temperature and air pressure delta is accurate for clean and dry fuel.

That's working, what I plan next is to push a KML file to Google maps on android and iOS devices that is of an airport terminal for that airport.
I hope to be able to report a direction to gates and airport services using maybe pins or gps coordinates.

The goal being an app that can help people new to an airport and alleviates that feeling of not knowing where to go when we've just landed.
